# gcHap_diversity_LANs_MVs-
The first step was to download the predominant gcHaps (with the highest frequency in 3KRG) of each OsGLR gene from the RFGB webpage (https://www.rmbreeding.cn/Index). The frequency drift of predominant gcHaps for each OsGLR gene between modern varieties (MVs) and landraces (LANs) was calculated based on an R script
